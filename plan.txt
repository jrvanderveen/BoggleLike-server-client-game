1) For this assignment I will create a server and client compliant with the given protocol.  The server will be the host for a basic word game where clients will have to create words
from a given set of letters until failure.  The server will be able to handle an arbitrary number of unique games between two clients.

2)As of now and because we are using a stream based protocol I do not see any faults with the protocol.

3)As of now I haven't seen anything that looks to challenging but possible dealing with clients leaving the game with out finishing could be hard to deal with.

4)I think it would be cool to write my own implementation for my trie structure but if it become to difficult I will update this plan with the open source version I decide to use.
